# News_Analysis
Newspaper Analysis using Big Data tools is my final year project. The aim is to learn distributed framework that can handle Big Data analysis. In my project system will takes an images or text files and it will extract text from images and classified them into related category. I am using Logistic Classification algorithm for train my model for this scenario. Pyspark is my interesting part that works with huge sets of data by processing them in parallel and batch systems. 
Languages used: Pyspark , Django, Hadoop, Python
